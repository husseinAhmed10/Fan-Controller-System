# Fan Controller System
 
The temperature control system app is a practical and useful application that allows users to control the temperature of a room or space with ease. It provides a simple interface, real-time temperature readings, and the ability to adjust settings and parameters to maintain a comfortable environment. With the use of various drivers and technologies, it offers a reliable and efficient solution to temperature control, making it an excellent choice for home or office use.
It uses an LM35 sensor to measure the temperature and a DC motor to control a fan's speed. The system initializes the used modules, such as the DC motor, ADC, and LCD, and continuously reads the temperature, processes the application logic, and updates the LCD with the current fan status and temperature reading.

**Project Features**
-Reading temperature using an LM35 temperature sensor and an ADC module.
-Controlling the speed of a DC motor fan based on the measured temperature using a PWM signal.
-Displaying the temperature and the state of the fan on an LCD screen.
-Using efficient and accurate drivers to control the hardware components, such as the DC motor, the LM35 sensor, the ADC module, and the LCD screen.

**The Drivers used:**
-DC Motor Driver: This driver is used to control the speed of the fan in the temperature control system based on the temperature readings obtained from the LM35 temperature sensor.
-ADC Driver: This driver is used to interface with the analog LM35 temperature sensor and convert the analog signal into a digital value that can be processed by the microcontroller.
-LM35 Sensor Driver: This driver is used to read the temperature value from the LM35 temperature sensor.
-LCD Driver: This driver is used to display the current status of the temperature control system on an LCD display.
